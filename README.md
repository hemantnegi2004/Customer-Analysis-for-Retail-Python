# Customer-Analysis-for-Retail-Python
Goal: To analyze customer transactions, demographics, and product hierarchies in a retail setting to extract actionable insights on customer behavior, sales performance, and store efficiency.

Description:
This case study focused on deriving insights from three datasets: Customer, Transaction, and Product Hierarchy. I used Python to clean, transform, and merge these datasets into a consolidated view (Customer_Final). Through extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), I performed statistical profiling, generated histograms for continuous features, and frequency plots for categorical variables. I answered specific business questions like identifying top-performing store types by value and quantity, analyzing category-wise gender preferences, and calculating revenue contributions from different cities and age groups. Negative transactions (returns) were filtered to ensure clean insights on purchasing trends.

Skills: data wrangling, merging datasets, exploratory data analysis, statistical summarization, business analytics, data visualization

Technology: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

Results:

Flagship stores had the highest revenue contribution in electronics and clothing.

Female customers showed higher purchases in specific categories compared to males.

Majority of high-value customers were clustered in a specific city code.

Identified age groups (25â€“35) contributing significantly to electronics and books categories during key periods.
These insights help retailers tailor marketing strategies and optimize store and inventory management.
